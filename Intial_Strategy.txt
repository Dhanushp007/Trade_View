Question: Hi, This is a new project that i have started working on, i dont have any idea of the technologies that have to used to achieve this and willing to learn along the way with this project.
I want a complete break down of creating a trading bot and trade view all the latest news and updates from the internet using trusted open source and use LLM's for analysis and view them in an interactive webpage, whilst training the model with all the available data in the internet to predict the movement in the stock, and also search for good stocks that stand out with all strong fundamental and techinal analysis. This project is mainly focused on indian stock market. Give me complete roadmap and break down in achieving this. And please help along the journey with proper answer with proof and research. 

GitHub Copilot: That’s an ambitious and exciting project! Here’s a detailed roadmap and breakdown for building a trading bot and interactive trade view platform focused on the Indian stock market, leveraging LLMs, news aggregation, and both fundamental and technical analysis.

## 1. Project Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Requirements & Research
- Define your goals and features (trading bot, news aggregation, LLM analysis, prediction, stock screener, interactive web UI).
- Research regulations for algorithmic trading in India (SEBI guidelines).
- Identify trusted data sources (NSE, BSE, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, News APIs, etc.).

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Storage
- Collect historical and real-time stock data (price, volume, etc.).
- Aggregate news and updates from trusted sources (RSS feeds, APIs).
- Store data in a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or TimescaleDB for time-series).

### Phase 3: Backend Development
- Build data ingestion pipelines (Python is recommended for finance/data).
- Implement APIs for data access (FastAPI or Flask).
- Integrate LLMs for news and sentiment analysis (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or open-source LLMs like Llama 3).

### Phase 4: Analysis & Prediction
- Implement technical analysis (TA-Lib, pandas-ta).
- Implement fundamental analysis (scrape or use APIs for financials).
- Train ML/LLM models for prediction (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or fine-tune LLMs).
- Backtest strategies.

### Phase 5: Trading Bot
- Implement trading logic (paper trading first, then real trading).
- Integrate with Indian brokers’ APIs (Zerodha Kite Connect, Upstox, Angel One, etc.).
- Add risk management and logging.

### Phase 6: Interactive Web Application
- Build a modern frontend (React.js, Next.js, or Vue.js).
- Visualize data (charts, news, predictions, stock screener).
- Add authentication and user management.

### Phase 7: Continuous Learning & Improvement
- Automate retraining of models with new data.
- Add feedback loops for model improvement.
- Monitor performance and logs.

## 3. Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Step 1: Set Up the Project
- Initialize a Git repo.
- Set up Python virtual environment.
- Create folders: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `data/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`.

### Step 2: Data Collection
- Use yfinance/NSEpy to fetch stock data.
- Use NewsAPI or scrape trusted news sites for news.
- Store data in a database.

### Step 3: Backend API
- Build REST API to serve stock data, news, and analysis.
- Use FastAPI for easy async APIs and documentation.

### Step 4: LLM Integration
- Use HuggingFace Transformers for news sentiment analysis.
- Optionally, use OpenAI API for advanced LLMs.
- Fine-tune models on Indian financial news for better accuracy.

### Step 5: Analysis & Prediction
- Implement technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.).
- Scrape or fetch fundamental data (P/E, EPS, etc.).
- Train ML models for price prediction and stock screening.

### Step 6: Trading Bot
- Start with paper trading (simulate trades).
- Integrate with broker API for real trades.
- Implement risk management (stop loss, position sizing).

### Step 7: Frontend Development
- Build dashboard with React.js.
- Show charts, news, predictions, and stock screener.
- Make it interactive and user-friendly.

### Step 8: Model Training & Continuous Learning
- Automate data collection and model retraining.
- Monitor model performance and retrain as needed.
